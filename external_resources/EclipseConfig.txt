=== How to setup MapExplorer development enviroment ===
== Requirements == 
Git (I recomend a cygwin install)
Ant
Ivy
java 1.6
Tomcat? - not nesserary in all configurations
Postgres + postgis? - not nesserary in all configurations

== Eclipse == 
= Prerequisite =
Eclipse J2EE
GWT plugin
Library Folder ClasspathContainer plugin

= Setting up the project = 
Create a new Eclipse Web Application (GWT) Project
  - package: uk.ac.ox.zoo.map.explorer
  - Use GWT, dont use GAE
  - Dont include sample code
 To a seperate (tempory) directory clone the MapExplorer repository
  - git clone ssh://will@map1.zoo.ox.ac.uk/home/will/workspace/MapExplorer.git
 Copy the ".git" into the new eclipse project (not via eclipse)
 Remove tempory directory
 From the MapExplorer project directory run a git checkout
  - git checkout .
 These steps make the project directory a clone of the map1 repository, while working around the "inital directory must be empty requirements of both eclipse and git"
  - Verify with "git status", should be on master branch with a clean working directory
Refresh the project in eclipse

= Setting up the classpath =
There is a known bug in the GWT eclipse plugin that it does not work correctly with Ivy classpaths (the gwt compile button will ignore ivy entries)
As such I recomend avoiding the ivy plugin for eclipse. Instead ant can be used to run ivy.
Ivy depends on the ivyconfig file in the MapCommon project
- Git clone the MapCommon project into the parent folder of the Explorer project
- git clone ssh://will@map1.zoo.ox.ac.uk/home/will/workspace/MapCommon.git
Use ant/ivy to retrive the dependancies
- Right click the build.xml ant file
- Select run as, ant build ...
- Select the eclipse-lib task only
- Run
- Refresh the project
- Add the lib and war/WEB-INF/lib directories to the eclipse buildpath (Add library -> workspace library)
Some of the dependancies are only availible for java6
- Make sure the JRE library in eclipse matches JavaSE-1.6
- Make sure that in the project facets configuration the java facet is set to version 1.6

Additionally, the dynamic web module project facet could be enabled to ease deploy to tomcat & other war tasks. However I find use of the current ant tasks to be more effective.
